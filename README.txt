Semantic Demo
-------------
- Demonstrating semantics from real-world coders perspective
- Implicit, so most people don't understand that semantics appear
- The data is noise without semantics, so semantics appear everywhere
- No need to argue for terminology; no this approach doesn't think truth value matters in semantics
